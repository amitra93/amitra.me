							<p>DARS for Dummies is a semester project built for CS 411. It uses a Chrome extension to parse out DARS reports from UIUC students to determine what classes you have taken already, and uses those to suggest what classes you still need to take to graduate, and recommends friends from Facebook to take the classes with. Recommendations are sorted by whoever you have taken most classes with in the past.</p>
							<br>
							<p>For this project, I designed the back-end, creating the schema for our Report, Requirements tables and also implemented our recommendations algorithm. I also wrote a scraper to pull in course information from the UIUC course catalog (such as full class name, the number of credit hours it fulfills, etc).</p>
							<br>
							<p>Used PHP/MySQL for backend and CSS/Javascript/jQuery for frontend.</p>
