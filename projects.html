							<p>DARS for Dummies is a semester project built for CS 411 (Database Systems). It uses a Chrome extension made in Javascript to parse out DARS reports from UIUC students to determine what classes you have taken already, and uses those to suggest what classes you still need to take to graduate, and recommends friends from Facebook to take the classes with. Recommendations are sorted by whoever you have taken most classes with in the past.</p>
							<br>
							<p>For this project, I designed the back-end using PHP/MySQL, creating the schema for our Report, Requirements tables and also implemented our recommendations algorithm. I also wrote a scraper to pull in course information from the UIUC course catalog (such as full class name, the number of credit hours it fulfills, etc).</p>

						<div class="va-content">
							<p>We built a face detection system using OpenCV that is capable of capturing frames from live video and identify the faces in it by cross referencing it with a database. Given training images in a database, we use a Principal Component Analysis algorithm so that each face detected from the live feed can be represented as a linear combination of the training faces. Based on a confidence level, we predict the closest match between our newly detected face and any of the faces in our database.</p>

							<p>This project was mentored by <a href="http://www.jiabinhuang.com/">Jia-Bin Huang</a> as part of the P.U.R.E program.</p>

							<p>AutoPi is a room automation system running on a Raspberry Pi controllable via an Android application.</p>
							<br>
							<p>The serverside was implemented in Python running on a Raspberry Pi which interfaced with GPIO pins on a breadboard using the RPi.GPIO library. The Raspberry Pi could turn lights in the room on/off by connecting the GPIO signals to a relay, and play music (controllable via MPC) through its speakers.</p>

							<p>This website is fully static, using CSS3 animations (for the sidebar), and jQuery for other animations. I use a plugin called pagify.js that loads content of different HTML pages into a single div so the page doesn't appear to reload. This website is best viewed on IE9+, Firefox 10+, and Chrome whatever+.</p>
