		I'm a rising junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Engineering. Currently, I'm working as an Application Developer intern at JPMorgan Chase, developing software for their Treasury and Security department. I'm interested in distributed systems and backend software development. I have finished coursework and projects in C/C++, LC3 Assembly, Java, Python, PHP and Javascript.

		Outside of school, I enjoy trying my hand at <a class="about" href="http://www.civilization5.com">global domination</a>, pressing <a class="about" href="http://www.leagueoflegends.com">Q/W/E/R</a>, <a class="about" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit">reading</a>, hanging out with friends, exploring new locations around Champaign, etc.
